# Trying Markdown

## Playing around with markdown
### playing .... ###


 This is my first attempt at markdown. I hope it is coming out correctly. **Amen.** 

*Italics* is one way to identify text. **Bold** is also another way to do it.
I can also make a link to a web page, like this on [YouTube](http://youtube.com) .

>> Guess I have to learn to spell... definitely. Or my tutor will be amazed at mispelling.

I will have to create a checklist too become a spelling Bee Champ;
1. Go to bed early
1. Eat my vegetables
1. Read my Bible, pray everyday and I'll grow, grow , grow.

This is just the beginning;
+ I will excercise intensely and become strong
+ Drink all my milk and eat my eggs
    + I will be the best
