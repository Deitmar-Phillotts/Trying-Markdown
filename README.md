# Trying Markdown

## Playing around with markdown
### playing .... ###


 This is my first attempt at markdown. I hope it is coming out correctly. **Amen.** 

*Italics* is one way to identify text. **Bold** is also another way to do it.
I can also make a link to a web page, like this on [YouTube](http://youtube.com) .
